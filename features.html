            <h5 style = "padding-top:20px"> Percent of Households Living Below Poverty</h5>
            <p>
                Areas of concentrated poverty are defined as census tracts where 40% or more of the population lives below the federal poverty line<sup>1</sup>. A main goal of housing choice vouchers is to deconcentrate poverty and allow low-income families to move into higher opportunity neighborhoods. Higher opportunity neighborhoods can provide more resources, such as higher quality schools, lower levels of crime, and access to better jobs<sup>2</sup>. Overlaying the percent of housing choice vouchers who live in a census tract with the percentage of households living below the poverty line in that census tract is a step toward understanding whether voucher holders move away from areas of concentrated poverty.
            </p>

            <h5 style = "padding-top:20px">Median Household Income</h5>
            <p>
                Median household income is the income level earned by a household where half of the households in that census tract earn less, and half earn more. Median household income is a more accurate measure of an areaâ€™s income level than average household income, since the average household income is more affected by very high and very low values. The median household income of a census tract can be a measure of the resources available to households, and as well as being closely tied to employment levels, educational attainment, and economic opportunities<sup>3</sup>.
            </p>

            <h5 style = "padding-top:20px">Population Density</h5>
            <p>
                Population density is a measure used to compare settlement intensity across census tracts, calculated as the number of people per square mile of land area<sup>4</sup>. Population density is greater in more crowded areas. A moderate increase in population density can sometimes cause an increased investment into resources, and serve a positive benefit of new amenities and improved infrastructure. However, high levels of population density can be a sign of increased crowding in schools, increased traffic, and increased crime rates. Higher population density can also be correlated with more high density housing, as neighborhoods with single-family homes generally have lower population densities than areas with many apartments<sup>5</sup>. Since homeownership is a marker of economic opportunity, this feature is important to track.

            </p>
            <h5 style = "padding-top:20px">Mean Rent of a Two Bedroom Apartment</h5>
            <p>
                Most residents use a housing choice voucher to subsidize their rent payments. The cost of rent is affected by a multitude of factors, but significant increases in rents can reflect the state of the housing market. In Durham, average rent has risen from $1,188 to $,307 in two years (from July 2019 to June 2021)<sup>6</sup>. These changes also reflect a rise in the cost of living.
