            <p> Durham CAN is based in institutions: congregations, associations, schools (both private and public), nonprofits, community health centers, and neighborhood organizations that share a concern for families and a tradition of faith and democracy.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>We strengthen congregations and community institutions</strong> by developing the skills and capacity of their leaders to be change agents in the public process. Durham CAN creates a vehicle for ordinary families to have a powerful voice in community decisions that affect their lives, instead of leaving decision-making in the hands of a select few.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>We build relationships of trust among people and institutions across Durham County</strong>, intentionally crossing boundaries of economics, race, age, religion, gender, sexual orientation and geography that divide our communities. Part of the dynamism of our work derives from a shared commitment to bring together individuals and families that typically do not know one another, and often do not know how to collaborate successfully.
            </p>

            <p> <strong>While not a religious organization, CAN's agenda reflects faith-informed and democratic values.</strong> CAN is often called upon to support member churches, synagogues, even dioceses, synods and conferences as they seek to address problems that impact families and communities.
            </p>

            <p>
                CAN and all its organizations are issue-driven politically non-partisan. <strong>We do not endorse any candidate or party for elected office</strong>, and instead put forth our issues agenda as our platform for constructive change.

            </p>

            <p>
