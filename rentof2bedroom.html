            <p>
                This dashboard shows where families with housing choice vouchers live in Durham. The map is of Durham County, and each shaded section represents a census tract<sup>1</sup>.  The shading represents what percentage of housing choice voucher residents live in that census tract.
            </p>
            <h5 style = "padding-top:0px">Directions</h5>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Scroll over the map to see the name of each census tract.</li>
                <li>Click on a census tract to see the specific percentage of housing choice voucher residents living in that census tract.</li>
                <li>Click the button below to add or change the graph’s features. The shaded circles represent another characteristic of each census tract. Bigger circles and darker colors represent a greater quantity. Click on a census tract to see the numerical data associated with the shading.</li>
                <li> Click and hold anywhere on the map to move around.</li>
                <li> In the upper left hand corner of the graph, click the “+” or “-” symbols to zoom in or zoom out. If you continue zooming in, it is possible to see road names. Check out where you live!</li>
                <li> The button below the “+” and “-” symbols lets you add or remove layers. You can deselect the checkbox to see Durham without the added map features.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The census tract shading remains the same in every graph. The bubbles will change based on the neighborhood characteristic selected. For all of the neighborhood characteristics, a larger circle represents a greater quantity. For some characteristics, such as the percentage of households living below the poverty line, high rates are of concern. For some characteristics, such as median household income, low rates are of concern. <!-- For example, a larger circle would represent a higher percentage of households living below the poverty line for the "Percent Below Poverty" selection, and a larger circle represents a higher median household income for the "Median Household Income" selection. -->
            </p>

            <p>
                Displaying neighborhood characteristics along with the percent of HCV residents per tract is important. According to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, neighborhood characteristics affect crime and delinquency, education, psychological distress, health problems, and more<sup>2</sup>.
